# Dev-only JavaScript

All JavaScript in this directory is NOT minified, concatenated, or included in the prod version of the site 
generated by the HTML5 boilerplate build script.  AJAX server calls are mocked in the mock.js file using 
mockjax, so when in dev, the site can be worked on without a backend server connection or database.

## JSend

AJAX calls in this project should use the [JSend](http://labs.omniti.com/labs/jsend) specification envelope for 
consistency, and since it's natively supported by AmplifyJS.
