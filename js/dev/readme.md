# Dev-only JavaScript

All JavaScript in this directoy is NOT minified, concatenated, and included in the prod version of the site 
generated by the HTML5 boilerplate build script.  AJAX server calls are mocked in the mock.js file using 
mockjax, so when in dev, the site can be worked on without a backend server connection or database.
